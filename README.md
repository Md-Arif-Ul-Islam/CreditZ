## 🔒 Data Security & Backup Specifications

CreditZ enforces a **Privacy-First** architecture, keeping all financial ledgers, customer profiles, and transaction records securely on-device.

### 1. Database Storage (SQLite)
The application utilizes an offline SQLite database for persistent transactional data:
- **Database Name**: `creditz.db`
- **Standard Location**:
  - **Android**: `/data/data/<package_name>/databases/creditz.db`
  - **iOS**: `~/Library/LocalDatabase/creditz.db`

### 2. Local Backup File
When executing a local backup, the SQLite schemas are compiled into a unified, encrypted-ready JSON layout:
- **Backup File Name**: `creditz_backup.json`
- **Application Documents Directory Paths**:
  - **Android**: `/data/user/0/<package_name>/app_flutter/creditz_backup.json`
  - **iOS**: `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<App-UUID>/Documents/creditz_backup.json`

### 3. Cloud Synchronization (Google Drive)
Cloud backups are authenticated through secure **OAuth 2.0 client authentication** using `GoogleSignIn`:
- **Auth Scope**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (limits app access to files created by this app only).
- **Target File**: `creditz_backup.json` uploaded directly to the user's secure Cloud drive container.
